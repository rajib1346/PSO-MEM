Within this approach, three models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting) are employed at each layer, utilizing the same training dataset. Their task is to classify the same test set, leveraging the most effective features available. The classifier that demonstrates a higher rate of correct classifications compared to the others is chosen to report its accuracy for the respective layer.

Upon completing the classification process within each layer, the data that has been accurately classified is incorporated into the pretraining dataset. This augmented dataset is subsequently introduced into the next layer as the training dataset. In the subsequent iteration, the data that was incorrectly classified in the previous step is utilized as the new test data. This iterative process continues until all three classifiers achieve true positive and true negative rates of zero. However, if all three classifiers fail to classify the data correctly, resulting in zero accuracy, the proposed model resorts to employing the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm to determine the optimal number of nearest neighboring data points. This entire process is known as the PSO-based multilayer dynamic steps are illustrated in Figure 1. The application of a multilayer prediction system significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions in machine learning. Each layer's correctly classified data can be utilized as a new training set for the subsequent layer, allowing the the extraction of previously unseen patterns from inaccurately classified data. Thus, accurately classified data within a layer provides invaluable insights to the model, contributing to its overall knowledge and performance.
